# Validating with mxcli check

You've created entities, microflows, and pages. Before opening your project in Studio Pro, you should validate that everything is correct. mxcli provides three levels of validation, each catching different kinds of problems.

## Level 1: Syntax check (no project needed)

The fastest check. It parses your MDL script and reports syntax errors without touching any `.mpr` file:

```bash
mxcli check script.mdl
```

This catches:

- Typos in keywords (`CRETE` instead of `CREATE`)
- Missing semicolons or parentheses
- Invalid attribute type syntax (`String` without a length)
- Anti-patterns like empty list variables used as loop sources
- Nested loops that should use `RETRIEVE` for lookups

You don't even need a project file for this. It's a pure syntax and structure check, so it runs instantly.

### Checking inline commands

You can also check a single statement:

```bash
mxcli check -c "CREATE PERSISTENT ENTITY MyModule.Product (Name: String(200));"
```

## Level 2: Syntax + reference validation

Add `-p` and `--references` to also verify that names in your script resolve to real elements in the project:

```bash
mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --references
```

This catches everything Level 1 catches, plus:

- References to entities that don't exist (`MyModule.NonExistent`)
- References to attributes that don't exist on an entity
- Microflow calls to non-existent microflows
- Page layouts that don't exist in the project
- Association endpoints pointing to missing entities

This is the check you should run before executing a script. It's fast (reads the project but doesn't modify it) and catches most mistakes.

## Level 3: Full project validation with mx check

After executing your script, validate the entire project using the Mendix toolchain:

```bash
mxcli docker check -p app.mpr
```

This runs Mendix's own `mx check` tool inside a Docker container. It performs the same validation that Studio Pro does when you open a project, catching issues that mxcli's parser cannot detect:

- BSON serialization errors (malformed internal data)
- Security configuration problems (missing access rules, CE0066 errors)
- Widget definition mismatches (CE0463 errors)
- Missing required properties on widgets
- Broken cross-references between documents

The first time you run this, it will download the MxBuild toolchain for your project's Mendix version. Subsequent runs reuse the cached download.

### Without Docker

If you have `mx` installed locally (e.g., from a Mendix installation), you can run the check directly:

```bash
~/.mxcli/mxbuild/*/modeler/mx check app.mpr
```

Or use mxcli to auto-download and run it:

```bash
mxcli setup mxbuild -p app.mpr
~/.mxcli/mxbuild/*/modeler/mx check app.mpr
```

## The recommended workflow

Here's the workflow you should follow for every change:

```
Write MDL --> Check syntax --> Execute --> Docker check --> Open in Studio Pro
```

In practice:

```bash
# 1. Write your MDL in a script file
cat > changes.mdl << 'EOF'
CREATE OR MODIFY PERSISTENT ENTITY MyModule.Product (
    Name: String(200) NOT NULL,
    Price: Decimal,
    IsActive: Boolean DEFAULT true
);

CREATE OR MODIFY MICROFLOW MyModule.CreateProduct(
    DECLARE $Name: String,
    DECLARE $Price: Decimal
)
RETURN MyModule.Product
BEGIN
    CREATE $Product: MyModule.Product (
        Name = $Name,
        Price = $Price,
        IsActive = true
    );
    COMMIT $Product;
    RETURN $Product;
END;
EOF

# 2. Check syntax (fast, no project needed)
mxcli check changes.mdl

# 3. Check references (needs project, still fast)
mxcli check changes.mdl -p app.mpr --references

# 4. Execute against the project
mxcli exec changes.mdl -p app.mpr

# 5. Full validation
mxcli docker check -p app.mpr

# 6. Open in Studio Pro and verify visually
```

## Previewing changes with diff

Before executing, you can preview what a script would change:

```bash
mxcli diff -p app.mpr changes.mdl
```

This compares the script against the current project state and shows what would be created, modified, or left unchanged. It does not modify the project.

## What mxcli check catches automatically

Beyond basic syntax, `mxcli check` includes built-in anti-pattern detection:

| Pattern | Problem | What check reports |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `DECLARE $Items List of ... = empty` followed by `LOOP $Item IN $Items` | Looping over an empty list does nothing | Warning: empty list variable used as loop source |
| Nested `LOOP` inside `LOOP` for list matching | O(N^2) performance | Warning: use RETRIEVE from list instead |
| Missing `RETURN` at end of flow path | Microflow won't compile | Error: missing return statement |

## Linting for deeper analysis

For a broader set of checks across the entire project (not just a single script), use the linter:

```bash
mxcli lint -p app.mpr
```

This runs 14 built-in rules plus 27 Starlark rules covering security, architecture, quality, and naming conventions. See `mxcli lint --list-rules` for the full list.

For CI/CD integration, output in SARIF format:

```bash
mxcli lint -p app.mpr --format sarif > results.sarif
```
