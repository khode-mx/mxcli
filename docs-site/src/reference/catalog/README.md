# Catalog Statements

The catalog is a SQLite database that caches project metadata for fast querying and cross-reference navigation. It is stored in `.mxcli/catalog.db` next to the MPR file.

A basic `REFRESH CATALOG` populates tables for modules, entities, attributes, associations, microflows, nanoflows, pages, snippets, enumerations, and workflows. A `REFRESH CATALOG FULL` additionally populates cross-references (REFS), widgets, strings, source text, and permissions -- enabling callers/callees analysis, impact analysis, and full-text search.

| [SELECT FROM CATALOG](select-from-catalog.md) | Query catalog tables with SQL syntax |
