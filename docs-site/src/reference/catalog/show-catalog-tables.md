# SHOW CATALOG TABLES

## Synopsis

    SHOW CATALOG TABLES

## Description

Lists all available catalog tables along with their column names and types. This is useful for discovering what metadata is queryable before writing `SELECT FROM CATALOG` queries.

The output includes both basic tables (populated by `REFRESH CATALOG`) and extended tables (populated by `REFRESH CATALOG FULL`). Tables that require a full refresh are marked accordingly.

## Parameters

This statement takes no parameters.

## Examples

### List all catalog tables

```sql
SHOW CATALOG TABLES;
```

### Typical workflow: discover then query

```sql
REFRESH CATALOG;
SHOW CATALOG TABLES;
SELECT * FROM CATALOG.ENTITIES LIMIT 5;
```
