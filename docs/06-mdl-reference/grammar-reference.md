```ebnf
program
    : statement* EOF

create persistent entity MyModule.Customer (
  Name: string(100) not null,
  Email: string(200) unique,
  Age: integer,
  Active: boolean default true

```

*Non-persistent entity for search filters:*

```sql
create non-persistent entity MyModule.SearchFilter (
query: string,
MaxResults: integer default 100,
IncludeArchived: boolean default false
);
```

*View entity with OQL query:*

```sql
create view entity MyModule.ActiveCustomers (
CustomerId: integer,
CustomerName: string(100)

select c.Id as CustomerId, c.Name as CustomerName
from MyModule.Customer as c
where c.Active = true;
```

*Entity with index:*

create microflow MyModule.GetGreeting ($Name: string) returns string
begin
return 'Hello, ' + $Name + '!';
end;

*Microflow with entity parameter and database operations:*

```sql
create microflow MyModule.DeactivateCustomer ($Customer: MyModule.Customer) returns boolean
begin
$Customer.Active = false;
commit $Customer;
return true;
end;
```

*Microflow with RETRIEVE and iteration:*

```sql
create microflow MyModule.CountActiveOrders () returns integer
begin
declare $Orders list of MyModule.Order;
$Orders = retrieve MyModule.Order where Active = true;
return length($Orders);
end;
```

*Microflow calling another microflow:*

```sql
create microflow MyModule.ProcessOrder ($Order: MyModule.Order) returns boolean
begin
$Result = call microflow MyModule.ValidateOrder (Order = $Order);
if $Result then
commit $Order;
return true;
end if;
return false;
end;

### oqlQuery

OQL (Object Query Language) query for retrieving data.  OQL is similar to SQL but operates on Mendix entities and supports associations, aggregations, and subqueries.

**Syntax:**

```ebnf
oqlQuery
    : selectClause fromClause? whereClause? groupByClause? havingClause?
    | orderByClause? limitOffsetClause?
    | | fromClause whereClause? groupByClause? havingClause?
    | selectClause orderByClause? limitOffsetClause?
```

**Railroad Diagram:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    state "selectClause" as s1
    [*] --> s1
    state "fromClause?" as s2
    s1 --> s2
    state "whereClause?" as s3
    s2 --> s3
    state "groupByClause?" as s4
    s3 --> s4
    state "havingClause?" as s5
    s4 --> s5
    s5 --> [*]
    state "orderByClause?" as s6
    [*] --> s6
    state "limitOffsetClause?" as s7
    s6 --> s7
    s7 --> [*]
    state "fromClause" as s8
    [*] --> s8
    state "whereClause?" as s9

    s12 --> s13
    state "limitOffsetClause?" as s14
    s13 --> s14
    s14 --> [*]
```

**Examples:**

*Simple SELECT query:*

```sql
select Name, Email from MyModule.Customer
```

*Query with WHERE clause:*

```sql
select c.Name, c.Email
from MyModule.Customer as c
where c.Active = true and c.Age > 18
```

*Query with JOIN via association:*

```sql
select o.OrderNumber, c.Name as CustomerName
from MyModule.Order as o
inner join o/MyModule.Order_Customer/MyModule.Customer as c
where o.Status = 'Completed'
```

*Aggregation query:*

```sql
select c.Country, count(*) as CustomerCount, avg(c.Age) as AvgAge
from MyModule.Customer as c
GROUP by c.Country
having count(*) > 10
ORDER by CustomerCount desc
```

*Subquery:*

```sql
select p.Name, p.Price
from MyModule.Product as p
where p.Price > (select avg(p2.Price) from MyModule.Product as p2)
```
